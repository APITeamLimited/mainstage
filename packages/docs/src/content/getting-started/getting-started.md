# Workspaces

APITeam is organized around workspaces, by default you will have a single personal workspace assoccated with your account. This is private to you and can be used to store your personal projects.

You can create collaborative team workspaces from the top right menu, you can invite other users to your team workspace and they will be able to view and edit your projects.

Although not initially obvious, clicking on the APITeam logo in the top-left returrns to the dashbaord

The Workspace Action Bar contains several useful actions, including:
- Seeing who is currently online in the workspace (team workspaces only)
- Creating a new project
- Switching between workspaces
- Creating a new team
- Inviting users to your team workspace
- Switching between light and dark mode
- Shortcuts for accessing your personal settings, logging out, and returning to the dashboard
